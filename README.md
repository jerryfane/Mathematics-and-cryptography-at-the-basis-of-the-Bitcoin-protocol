## Abstract

Since the publication of the Bitcoin protocol whitepaper, 10 years have passed and few people are still familiar with the mechanisms that have allowed this peer-to-peer payment network to function without interruption. 
In a world that is becoming increasingly globalized and digital, the birth of an electronic payment system was inevitable, and Bitcoin is just one of many attempts to do so. 
Before Bitcoin, there had already been several approaches to linking digital coins to cryptographic and mathematical-based systems such as Hashcash, Bit Gold and B-Money. 
Bitcoin is the first solution able to use not only cryptographic models, such as Hash functions, but in addition it has designed a decentralized network based on a system of economic incentives. 
In fact, the first Blockchain was established, which together with Bitcoin is proving to be a solid and functioning technology. 
The aim of this thesis is to explain in clear and easily accessible language how this payment model is able to operate autonomously. 
The topics dealt with are mainly focused on cryptographic and mathematical explanations in such a way as to be understandable even to those who do not have the technical skills. 
Starting from a general definition of Bitcoin and its main features, it will be explained in detail how the monetary system works, how transactions are validated and what are the incentives to validate transactions. 
Finally the more technical topics, such as Hash, Public Key Infrastructure, Proof-of-Work and how these have been applied within the protocol. 
To facilitate understanding, examples are provided using Python, and the reader will also be able to directly test the information explained with the codes made available.
